# Edit_magic_cv_web
It's a basic image editing website that allows a user to upload an image, and then perform some operations on the image like detecting Edges, Contours, Increasing the brightness,
etc. And then download the processed image.
It is built using HTML, CSS, AND Javascript along with OpenCV.js. OpenCV.js is a JavaScript binding for the OpenCV library. It allows you to use OpenCV functionality directly 
in web applications using JavaScript. OpenCV.js brings the power of computer vision and image processing to the web browser.
